# Garden Harvest

A summer garden child theme for Stargazer inspired by one of my favorite summer treats - fresh, ripe, home-grown tomatoes. This is a child theme for the [Stargazer](http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer) parent theme.  You must install the parent theme in order to use this child theme.
